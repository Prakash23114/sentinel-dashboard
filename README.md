🛡️ SENTINEL – Enterprise AI Observability & Governance Platform

SENTINEL is a unified AI observability and governance dashboard designed for banking institutions to monitor, manage, and govern both Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The platform provides real-time monitoring, compliance oversight, performance analytics, and executive-level insights through a structured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

🚀 Problem Statement

Banks increasingly rely on:

Traditional ML models for fraud detection, credit scoring, and risk assessment.

Large Language Models (LLMs) for customer interaction, automation, and internal assistance.

However, monitoring these systems remains fragmented, leading to:

Model performance degradation

Hallucination and safety risks

Rising infrastructure costs

Compliance and regulatory challenges

Lack of executive visibility

SENTINEL solves this by providing a unified observability dashboard tailored to different stakeholders within a banking ecosystem.
